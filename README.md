# CSC-132-Smart-Terrarium
CSC 132 Final Pi Project

## Raspberry Pi Smart Terrarium

This project is called the Raspberry Pi Smart Terrarium. It is an automated plant-care system contained in a glass case that uses the Raspberry Pi,
LED lights, a 2-in-1 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensors, and a water pump to provide care for plants and relay live information
on plant and terrarium conditions to the user, helping them to interact with the system and their plants in manners that encourage education and growth.

The primary goal of this project was to streamline the process of plant care while helping even the most novice gardeners provide exceptional care 
for their plants. By providing our users with detailed yet comprehensible information on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
they will be more knowledgeable about the conditions of the plants in their terrarium and better equipped to act and care for their plants.

Ultimately, the goal was to construct an automated plant-care system that can provide our users with knowledge, vibrant plant growth, and an automated,
time-saving gardening experience they can enjoy.
